Who am I?
----------------------------
 - I'm Henry Langmack, a mostly self-taught programmer.  
 - I'm 14, and I'm currently living in New Jersey. I started programming around 2016 and was introduced by a cousin.  
 - Shortly after I started attending KidOYO during summers and have been doing some student-mentor work there since last summer.
